# Navigation Inspiration — Sushma Rathod

This repository contains my Week-1 task for Research & Inspiration based on responsive navigation design.

## 📌 Contents
- notes.md — list of researched websites + observations  
- patterns.md — extracted navigation patterns with examples  
- moodboard.pdf — Canva-based visual moodboard  
- screenshots/ — desktop + mobile screenshots for each website

## 🎯 Objective
To explore how different websites use responsive navigation systems, identify common patterns, and collect visual inspiration for future UI design.

## 🧩 Key Learnings
- Mobile navigation mostly uses hamburger + off-canvas pattern.
- Desktop navigation often uses horizontal top bar with dropdowns.
- Sticky navigation improves usability by keeping main actions visible.
- Bottom navigation works best for app-like experiences on mobile.
